# Command line software

- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) makes it possible to carry out complex
  queries and transformation on JSON on the CLI. Great for scripting APIs.

- [unp](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/unp) is a tool that unpacks archives. It
  recognizes archive type from suffix and uses the right CLI tool to unpack it.
  Can be installed on ubuntu with `apt install unp`.
