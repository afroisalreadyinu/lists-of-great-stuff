# Python libraries

- [Docker SDK](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a
  feature-complete client for the docker service; `docker-compose` is written
  using it. If you have any complicated Docker business, much better than using
  bash and the Docker cli client.

- [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) doesn't need an
  introduction. Thanks to it, gazillions of Python devs do not have to re-google
  the arcane interface of `urllib`.

- [sanic](https://github.com/huge-success/sanic) is an asynchronous Python web
  framework. It's API is very similar to Flask, only in async. Well-written and
  performant.
